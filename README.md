# Advent of Code 2022

Contains solutions and spoilers, you have been warned. 

## Learning Rust

The primary goal of AoC for 2022 was to learn Rust and scratch an itch. Many solutions are implemented with the goal of learning Rust. So they may be:

* Verbose
* Suboptimal
* Over-engineered on purpose
* etc. 

If a solution presented a Rust feature I had used much yet, I used it as a learning opportunity.
